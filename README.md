Hi there ðŸ‘‹, and welcome to my github homes! Iâ€™m Rahul(rk-tech), a FullStack Software Engineer at [@Amdocs](https://www.amdocs.com/). My technical expertise includes proficiency in Angular, React, and Next.JS for front-end development, as well as Node.JS, Express, and GraphQL for back-end development. I have a keen eye for developing modular architecture and ensuring the longevity of my code.

My passion for writing code extends beyond just making life easier, but it is a way of crafting elegant solutions that leave a lasting impact.
