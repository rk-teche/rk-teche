Hi there ðŸ‘‹, and welcome to my github home! Iâ€™m Rahul, [rk-tech.io](https://rk-tech.io/), a FullStack Software Engineer at [@Amdocs](https://www.amdocs.com/). My technical expertise includes proficiency in Angular, React, and Next.JS for front-end development, as well as Node.JS, Express, and GraphQL for back-end development. My knowledge of databases covers mySQL, MongoDB, and ElasticSearch.

I have a strong understanding of Git and Bitbucket for version control and have experience in deploying CD/CI pipelines using Jenkins, Docker, and Linux. With a solid foundation in Data Structures and Algorithms, as well as Design Patterns and SOLID Principles, I have a keen eye for developing modular architecture and ensuring the longevity of my code.

My passion for writing code extends beyond just making life easier, but it is a way of crafting elegant solutions that leave a lasting impact.
